## *setup scorekeeper*

#### **command usage:**

`%setup scorekeeper <scores role id> ([rkd|rkw|rkm] [rk role])... ([kcd|kcw|kcm] [kc role])...`  
→ `[roles]` - setting roles for assigning to winners  
*examples* `%setup scorekeeper 876409193962274816 rkd 816814079213043714`

#### **data To store:**

current date, year, month, week, day, doty, dotw, sksetup, kcdRole, kcwRole, kcmRole, kcRole, rkdRole, rkwRole, rkmRole, rkRole, skRole, registeredRole

#### **processes:**

- check `sksetup` for a `true` value to determine whether certain processes will occur  
  if undefined:
	- join month, day, and year values for the dayStamp *ex. 11292022*
	- create array (list) of all currently registered players with the scores role → store in `server variable` → `registeredUsers`
	- create the following JSON files (==keys to be decided later==)
		- scorekeeping.json
		- daylog.json
		- weeklog.json
		- monthlog.json
		- records.json
		- template-log.json
		- skvariables.json
	- control saved data values and variables to = the data stored and generated
	- create null keys for keys to be filled later
	- prints a list of current registered players that should be setup
if true:
	- and no roles roles are passed, the bot will collect and store all values declared and generated by this command
		- print them to be viewed in the command channel
	- If variables are passed it will update the data with the roles as given
